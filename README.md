I'm Gr8ful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It takes 21 days to start a new habit. By finding three things to be grateful for each day, we can get in the habit of being happier and more grateful.

This app will be function as a wall of gratitude where users can anonoymously share, edit and delete what they are grateful for.

Since all users are allowed to post, edit and delete entries, they are therefor encouraced to moderate the page as an autonymous hivemind.

Future Additions
I will add more CSS to make website more aesthetically pleasing.
I would also like to add a gratitude journal feature where users can sign on to their own account to have a private list of three things they are grateful for each day, as well as have a counter that can count streaks of posts for consecutive days.
